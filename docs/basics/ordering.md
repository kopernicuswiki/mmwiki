Every mod that is present in a KSP install is recognized and sorted alphanumerically for processing by ModuleManager. Every subfolder of a mod is also read in alphanumeric order for patches but is not automatically counted as a mod. These are typically mods that come as sub-mods like forum user **@theJesuit**'s ANGLEcan mods, **@LinuxGuruGamer**'s SpaceTux Recycled Parts, **@RoverDude**'s Umbra Space Industries, and **@Angel-125**'s Wild Blue Industries. Mods presented in this manner need to at least contain one patch that contains `@NODE:FOR[thisMod]` to be recognized by the oredering system.

Some plugins, such as B9 Part Switch, are extremely sensitive to the arrangements of MM configs so be careful to always have **Config1** which needs to run before **Config2**, sorted properly by either their filenames, the order of their patches within the same file, the order of the subfolders that contain them, or any pseudo-mods that they create and run for (see: the FOR pass). When ModuleManager performs its run, it goes through a number of sequences and it executes each patch according to this grand assortment. It also executes each patch according to its requirements.

See [LEGACY](passes.md#legacy) for the ordering sequence.

To set this sequence and the requirements for a given patch you must suffix your MM operation with any of the following and within restrictions:
